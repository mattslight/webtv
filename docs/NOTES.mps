How I would differentiate from YouNow:-

1)    Focus on the audience – aim to be a replacement for TV NOT social media
a.    This is about disrupting TV --- NOT SOCIAL MEDIA
                                          i.    WHY : TV is an industry that has failed to innovate and is ripe for fresh innovations from modern tech
                                         ii.    First and foremost this will look and feel like a modern day replacement for TV (not joe blogs in his bedroom with a guitar) – YouNow founder mentioned the cream rising to the top, yet showed an average performance by a novice guitarist – what would the top 0.1% of content look like from an audience of 1mil ? (10 mil?) – (100mil?)  (1bn…)
                                        iii.    What would TV look like in a world where the internet came first and TV never existed…
2)    Focus on quality live content in specific “channels” which capture “prime-time” audience, DON’T FOCUS ON THE LONG TAIL. DON’T COMPETE WITH NETFLIX ON PRODUCTION QUALITY. Beat NETFLIX on live rather than production. You only need 1 world class performer to attract the attention of the entire world (but still provide ability to drill down into niche content which is not on the main channel, niche content is for the audience)
3)    Provide content specific tools – this is how you mitigate against cannibalisation, also by focusing on the
4)    Live GROUP engagement (not the 1-1 experience as per YouNow)
a.    Engagement could be:-
                                          i.    Audience video-ins / panel discussions
                                         ii.    Audience Q&As
                                        iii.    Changing camera feed in real-time (this might be camera angles or something else)
                                         iv.    Rich platform specific overlays
                                          v.    Sports – stats on your favourite players, who has the best batting average
                                         vi.    Voting (polls)

Some secondary hypotheses to test/push the boundaries in areas where YouNow is not innovating:-
a.    Explore semi-seeded / produce low-budget content, look for performers who already have an audience and video would unlock a 3rd dimension for them
                                        vii.    E.g. I run a real-crime podcast, I can now show case evidence files, show layouts of the murderer’s whereabouts on the day of the murder on a map, demonstrate visually how the attacker could have seduced his/her victim, I can run a panel discussion from my bookstore and people who don’t live in my town can attend virtually
                                       viii.    I run sports content podcast, now I can spin up live panel discussions, show graphic overlays of tactics and/or play formations just like Sky Sports
                                         ix.    I am a retired sports professional, I run a coaching setup for kids, now I can broadcast these sessions and kids in remote areas can have access to my coaching facilities and can ask Q/A in real-time, the coach can see live actions of the audience
b.    Democratise content
                                          x.    Promote and provide tools for self-organising channel producers (some performers coming together to produce crowd-sourced content). Allow that group to moderate / curate and produce that topic’s content
                                         xi.    Ideas from Reddit / Wikipedia would be taken around democratised content curation
                                        xii.    E.g. Live broadcast of video gaming events, e.g. tournament finals, audience votes for which map / level will be next
                                       xiii.    Group yoga for Mums at home, turn on the camera and microphone and all of a sudden she doesn’t have to leave the house and can participant in a quick 20-minute yoga session and talk to her friends whilst baby is sleeping in the bedroom
c.    Test reputation rather than money as the rewarder
d.    Provide tools for specific content types (not simple 1-1 style bedroom chats)
                                        xiv.    E.g. tools for hooking up go pros and providing multiple camera views,
                                         xv.    hook up a drone camera for Ariel view
e.    What happens when you add in the periscope concept in that anybody can be a camera man and can broadcast anywhere
                                        xvi.    so for Breaking News events as it unfolds we can connect wannabe journalists on the ground and provide real-time video in places where it would be impossible for traditional News crew to be
                                       xvii.    Students at a lecture can broadcast live with just using their phone
                                      xviii.    BUT I see Periscope as a subset of hyperlocal content generation – THIS is the differentiator from Periscope
f.      Test what happens if you add-in competing for the top spot – does this lead to better quality content? What happens if you promote self-organising groups of content? Which produces the better results?
g.    Experiment ---- Have a channel which is like America’s got talent and audience can “BUZZ” off the content if it gets boring
h.    How can international markets be served – think HSBC, NOT the world’s local bank, but, the world’s local TV channel
                                       xix.    How does Indian content differ from American? What appeals to the African market?
                                        xx.    How can we provide native speaking content for prime-time audiences in Spanish, French, Arabic, Hindi, Mandarin, Russian
                                       xxi.    How does content that caters for a local market differ from global prime-time content
                                      xxii.    Focus on getting the positioning right for a smaller audience with sufficient ability to scale like Britain / Australia / South Africa / New Zealand… then attack India and America… lastly attack China as yy will be VERY tough competition to penetrate --- Need to think about this more, this is just my gut feeling
